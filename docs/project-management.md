# Project Management Tips

1. A small team (<10) is a happy team.
2. Everyone in the team uses pen and paper for self `todo lists`.
3. For a small centralized team, project management on paper is superior.
4. `Slow is good`. Allocate extra grace time for completion of todo items.
5. Allocate extra grace time for completion of product.
6. Manually test the software product, by hand.
7. Document a list of user tests to be performed before every version release.
8. Version product releases as `major.minor.patch`. Bump minor release number more than major release number.
9. First version should always be `v0.1.0`.
10. Everyone in the team uses every product. User testing is valuable.
