“ Computer programming is about writing software applications for own use, for team use, or for use by everyone in the organization. ”
```

A computer has three parts -
1. A display monitor
2. A processing unit to run programs/software applications
3. Input devices like a keyboard and a mouse

Software applications are written in a computer programming language. Examples are -
1. C
2. C++
3. Java
4. PHP

## What is PHP
PHP is one of the well known programming languages. It is designed specifically to be used with HTML, which is used for building graphical user interface (GUI) with XML (Extended Markup Language) like syntax.

There are three languages related to PHP - 

1. HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
	* GUI part of an application
	* Viewed in a Web Browser like `Mozilla Firefox` or similar
2. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
	* Colors, backgrounds and layouts part of an application
3. PHP itself - PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
	* Executable part of an application
	* Connects to a database for example

Before we study PHP, lets start with HTML, then CSS and finally PHP.

## HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language is used to build graphical user interfaces for a web browser. 

A web browser is often associated with accessing the internet, websites and web pages. Looking closely, internet is not a requirement for building graphical user interfaces with HTML. An example of this is saving a webpage to your computer. It gets saved as file - `website.html`.

Required tools for writing GUI with HTML
1. Computer (without a network connection)
2. Text editor like `Notepad++`
3. Web browser like `Firefox` to view the output

Here is a sample of HTML code
```raw
<html>
<head>
	<title>Sample HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
	<a href="example.html">Link to Example page</a>
	<a href="example2.html">Link to Example 2 Page</a>
</body>
</html>
```
